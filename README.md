# Tideman Election Simulator

Made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [SSVM](https://www.secondstate.io/)

This is based on the [CS50 assignment](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/3/tideman/)
of the same. Add your candidates, add ballots, and cast votes on each ballot.
Click on the big button at the bottom to see the results of the election.

Try it out [on Heroku](https://tideman-ssvm.herokuapp.com/)

Remember to run `ssvmup build` before starting the server. See [here](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm-nodejs-starter#use-docker-to-build-and-run)
if you need a Docker image to run things in.
